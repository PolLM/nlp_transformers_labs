## Repository Overview

This repository is a collection of exercises and code that I wrote to understand and apply the content from the book. Most of the code snippets are derived from the book, with minor modifications. Additionally, I have included some experimental scripts and tests to further explore and extend my knowledge of the material.

### File Organization

The files are organized by chapter as follows:

```

Note that the organization of the files may not exactly follow the structure of the book's original repository. I have written the code in a way that is comfortable and helps me better understand and learn the content.
